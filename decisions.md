|001| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | create a separate repository for the language spec       | Single source of truth for multiple implementations. Avoids duplicate documentation. Easy to version, reference, and maintain. |
|002| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | document things in the most compact form                 | Easy to maintain. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Out of date documentation is worse than no documentation. |
|003| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | markdown is the main format of documentation             | Can be viewed on GitHub directly. Simple. Works well with version control. Easier to write than Sphinx documentation. |
|004| 2025-06-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | document core feature set in the README                  | The README is the first page you see when you open the repository on GitHub. It is good if the high level overview and the single-source of truth is right there. |
|005| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | document language features in a table of type signatures | Easy to maintain. Fits on a single screen. Easy to search. Brainstorming or details and discussion can be placed in other markdown files and linked directly in the table. |
|006| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | document design decisions in a table                     | WHY something was done in a particular way is super important to allow understanding and revising decisions later on. Design documents proved to be out of date too quickly and too time-consuming. |
|007| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | document design decisions of all projects in one file    | Keeps implementation repositories focused on the code. It's easier to find decisions if they are all in one place. The project and tag fields should allow searching effectively. |
|008| 2025-04-06 | 009           | lambda     | @pm         | omit file extension on decision file                     | Easy to open in a spreadsheet program to search and edit. Hopefully GitHub will still recognize it as Markdown and render it as such. |
|009| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | .md file extension on decision file, instead of none/CSV | GitHub needs the .md file extension to render it as markdown. Probably I will use the GitHub preview more often than a spreadsheet. |
|010| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @pm         | split the single lambda project into many small projects | Separation of concerns on the project level. Smaller scope. No interactions between features. Much easier to experiment with language features. Allows re-implementating the core to gain experiece. |
|101| 2025-04-06 |               | lambda     | @lang       | use symbolic expressions like Lisp                       | Easy to lex and parse. Parentheses may negatively impact readability but also make the syntax homogeneous, simple, and easy to extend. |
|102| 2025-04-11 |               | lambda     | @lang       | define a small language Core and optional Extensions     | Decrease the initial implementation effort for an interpreter or compiler. Allows individual coding projects to experiment with the Core and just one Extension at a time. Allows faster and easier experimentation that one large codebase which tries to implement everything. |
