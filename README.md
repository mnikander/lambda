# A Lambda Language Specification

The syntax of a lambda language is specified here.
It uses Lisp-style symbolic expressions.
The language is defined by:
1. a [grammar](grammar.md)
2. a set of [core](core.md) features
3. a set of [possible extensions](extensions.md)
4. the type [signatures](signatures.md) of its in-built functions

## Implementation Projects

The following repositories implement part of this lambda language:

1. [Interpreter](https://github.com/mnikander/interpreter)
2. [Transpiler](https://github.com/mnikander/transpiler)

## Further Reading
- design decisions are documented in a [decision log](decisions.md)
- a [primer](notes/primer.md) on symbolic expressions
